Bras√≠lia, June 2021.

The Academic Management Support System (SAGA) stands as a technological solution designed to enhance performance monitoring and analysis in undergraduate courses. Integrated with Power BI, SAGA provides a set of interactive charts, enabling clear visualization of a wide range of academic data. This feature facilitates the interpretation of indicators, contributing to evidence-based management.

A key differentiator of SAGA is its capability for trend projection, particularly regarding student dropout. The system employs analytical models to predict dropout risks, offering managers the opportunity for proactive intervention. This functionality emerges as a strategic resource, empowering institutions to develop specific action plans for student retention.

Beyond traditional indicator monitoring, SAGA is enriched with a predictive analysis module. This module works with variables and historical patterns to provide accurate estimates, allowing for more assertive academic management. Thus, the system not only diagnoses the current scenario but also anticipates future scenarios, aiding in the formulation of more effective academic policies.

In summary, SAGA positions itself as an essential tool for academic managers seeking to optimize processes and improve educational outcomes. With the implementation of this system, higher education institutions are expected to reach a new level of excellence in academic management.
