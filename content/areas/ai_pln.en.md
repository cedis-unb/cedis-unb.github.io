Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks to develop systems capable of mimicking and enhancing human abilities such as reasoning, learning, and perception. One of its most fascinating subareas is Natural Language Processing (NLP), dedicated to understanding and interpreting human language, allowing machines and programs to interact with people more efficiently and intuitively. NLP encompasses everything from syntactic and semantic analysis of words to the generation of coherent and meaningful text, enabling the creation of virtual assistants, automatic translation systems, and other applications that facilitate communication and information access in our daily lives.

## About the Coordinator
**Prof. Sergio Antônio Andrade de Freitas**

Professor and researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), he holds a tenure position at the University of Brasília - UnB. Some of his contributions to the field of NLP include the automated interpretation of anaphoras, a pioneering study that deepened the understanding of how machines can process and interpret human text, contributing to the resolution of anaphoras and advancements in computational text comprehension. Moreover, his research in AI explores the integration of advanced computational methods to develop more intelligent and intuitive systems, enhancing human-computer interaction and promoting technological innovations in the field. Currently, he is a faculty member of the Software Engineering course and an active member of the Graduate Program in Applied Computing (PPCA). {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "More information" >}}.
