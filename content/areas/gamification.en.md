Gamification is a process that uses elements, techniques, and game design mechanics in contexts not related to games, aiming to increase user motivation, participation, and engagement. Gamification has been applied in various fields, such as education, marketing, health, and corporate training, becoming a growing trend over the last decade. Recently, the group launched the website [Gamification.org](https://gamificacao.org), which gathers resources, projects, and discussions related to the subject. The initiative seeks to consolidate knowledge and provide a collaborative environment for researchers, educators, and professionals interested in gamification.

1. [Portal for training and identifying the motivational profile of a target audience to be gamified](https://publish.obsidian.md/sergio-freitas): A web portal designed for training and identifying the motivational profile of a target audience for gamification. This portal includes practical sections for judge teams to evaluate motivational profiles. The resulting motivational profile is an Octalysis profile. Teams monitor the development of motivational profiles and compare them with others. The portal uses questionnaires for profile creation and is constantly evolving to incorporate new methods of identifying motivational profiles. 2023. Private site, available only upon request to the author. Author: {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}}.

2. Fundamentals of Computer Architecture, gamified as "Knowledge Battle": The restructured class as "Knowledge Battle," a gamified educational experience. This innovative format, based on McGonigal's concepts and the Octalysis framework, transforms the classroom into an interactive learning space. Students participate in knowledge duels, answering questions about class topics, and earn "patacas" based on the quality of their answers. The contents are previously made available through the textbooks adopted in the class, encouraging prior study. Gamification proved effective in increasing student engagement and enjoyment in the learning process, 2015. Available resources: Standardized forms for monitoring duels and spreadsheets for identifying similar player profiles. Start: 2015, concluded in 2017.
