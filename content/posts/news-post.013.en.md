Brasília, November 11, 2024  

**The paper developed by Éber Junio Borges Moreira and Sergio Antonio Andrade de Freitas, researchers at the University of Brasília (UnB), was recognized with the Best Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET 2024), held in Paris, France, from November 6 to 8, 2024.**

Titled _A CP-SAT Approach for Academic Resource Timetabling in Higher Education Institutions: A Case Study at a Major Public University_, the paper proposes an innovative model for scheduling academic resources using constraint programming with Google OR-Tools’ CP-SAT. The study was applied at UnB, demonstrating how the model can optimize academic resource allocation according to specific institutional and methodological constraints.

The authors of the paper are:

- **Éber Junio Borges Moreira**, researcher at the PPCA and affiliated with the STI at the University of Brasília (UnB).
- **Sergio Antonio Andrade de Freitas**, full professor at UnB and researcher at CEDIS at the University of Brasília (UnB).

This work represents a contribution to academic resource management, offering a scalable solution for university scheduling and improving administrative efficiency in the educational context. The model allows adaptation to different scenarios and institutional requirements, and the tested methodology showed promising results, with an optimized solution in all analyzed cases.

In a statement, Éber Junio emphasized the significance of the award: "Receiving this recognition at ITHET is a testament to the effort and the potential impact of this research on educational resource management."

The recognition highlights the commitment of CEDIS and the University of Brasília to high-quality research and innovation on the international stage. The paper can be accessed [here](https://www.ithet.net/).
