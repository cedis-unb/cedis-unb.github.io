**The paper presented by Mylena Faria, a Software Engineering student and fellow of the Canal Ciência project at CEDIS, received the Best Paper Award at the 24th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2024), held in Hanoi, Vietnam.** 

The paper, titled A process to identify players' motivational profiles for designing a gamification project, was recognized for its innovative approach to identifying motivational profiles in gamification projects. The study proposes a personalized and adaptable process to enhance the effectiveness of gamification, focusing on its application to the Canal Ciência portal, a Brazilian government initiative that aims to engage Brazilian students in scientific learning.

The paper was developed by the following authors:

- **Cristiane Soares Ramos**, Professor at the University of Brasília (UnB) and researcher at CEDIS.
- **Mylena Faria**, Software Engineering student, University of Brasília (UnB) and fellow at CEDIS.
- **Sergio Antonio Andrade de Freitas**, Professor at the University of Brasília (UnB) and researcher at CEDIS.
- **Marcus Vinicius Paiva Martins**, Software Engineering student, University of Brasília (UnB) and fellow at CEDIS.
- **Leda Sampson**, Researcher at IBICT (Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology).

The {{< link-interno "/projects/canal_ciencia" "Canal Ciência project" >}} is maintained by IBICT, with funding provided by Finatec, and aims to make scientific and technological knowledge accessible to the Brazilian population. The gamification component, which was the focus of the award-winning paper, seeks to engage students more effectively through interactive learning experiences.

Mylena, who represented the research team at the conference, expressed her gratitude: "Winning the Best Paper Award was an incredible recognition of our team's efforts. It shows the importance of combining technology and education to foster scientific dissemination. I’m grateful to the co-authors and the entire Canal Ciência project team for their support."

The award highlights the commitment of CEDIS and its partners in promoting high-quality research and innovation on a global stage. The recognition reinforces the potential impact of gamification in education and the broader field of scientific communication.
