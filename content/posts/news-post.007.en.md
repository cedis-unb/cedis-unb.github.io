**Prof. Sergio Freitas innovates in Software Engineering education with RPG gamification at the University of Brasília.**

The Human-Computer Interaction course, taught by Prof. {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}} at the University of Brasília since the 2022/1 semester, has been gaining attention for its innovative teaching approach: the "IHC Journey" gamification. The method, which combines elements of RPG (Role Playing Game) games with academic learning, is transforming the educational experience for Software Engineering students.

Developed by Prof. Freitas, an expert in gamification, the "IHC Journey" is based on the Octalysis framework, providing a student-centered learning experience that is both engaging and effective. In this system, students take on the roles of characters like Knights, Mages, Archers, and Priests, each with unique abilities that influence the learning process and teamwork.

The game's rules include forming teams, where each student chooses a character and participates in main and side quests, exploring different knowledge territories. Battles, one of the most exciting components of the game, are moments of testing and applying acquired knowledge, where teams compete against each other in challenges based on the course content.

This gamified approach not only increases student engagement but also promotes autonomy and collaboration, essential elements in the development of relevant skills in the Software Engineering field. Moreover, character progression and the reward system in coins and experience points encourage active and continuous participation from students throughout the semester.

The success of the "IHC Journey" is evident in the adoption and enthusiasm of the students, who report a more dynamic and immersive learning experience. This pedagogical innovation by Prof. Freitas not only enriches the curriculum at the Faculdade do Gama but also serves as an inspiring model for other educational institutions seeking more effective and appealing teaching methods.
