**Innovative gamification by Prof. Sergio Freitas engages Software Engineering students with a playful and effective approach.**

The Software Development course at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) of the University of Brasília (UnB) is causing quite a stir with its innovative teaching approach, thanks to the introduction of the gamification "Feudal Dawn" by Prof. {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}}.

Aimed at students from the ABI Engineering up to the third period as well as Software Engineering students, the course now stands out with a pioneering and highly effective teaching methodology. "Feudal Dawn" is not just a game; it is a pedagogical transformation that places the student at the center of the learning process, making it more engaging and motivating.

Based on the Octalysis framework, developed by Yu-kai Chou, the course combines theory and practice, balancing extrinsic and intrinsic motivations to create an adapted and personalized learning environment. The introduction of advanced technological features, such as MS Power Apps applications, Sharepoint site, dashboards in Power BI, and a thematic player's guide, all integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform, adds an extra layer of interactivity and engagement.

The gamified aspect of the course is reflected in its varied roles for players, including Monarch (professor), Dukes (team leaders), and Advisors (advanced students), with scoring through "Patacas" and the organization of students into thematic fiefs. This captivating narrative serves as a backdrop for activities, encouraging collaboration and immersion in the content.

Since its introduction in the 2021/2 academic semester, the course has shown impressive student adherence, with classes almost always reaching maximum capacity. The flexibility of the course, which transitioned from in-person to remote and back, in response to the global scenario, demonstrates its adaptability and relevance.

"Feudal Dawn" is not just a teaching method; it's indicative of an evolution in engineering education. The course is a prime example of how innovation and technology can transform education, promoting more effective, engaging, and tailored learning to meet the needs of today's students.
