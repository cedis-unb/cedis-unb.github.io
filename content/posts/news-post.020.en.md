Brasília, September 1, 2025  

The **Introduction to Gamification** course welcomed, on **September 1, 2025**, the **Gamification Team from Banco do Brasil**, who delivered a lecture open to the entire class.  

During the session, the speakers presented the **various gamification projects and products** developed by the Bank’s team, highlighting experiences applied in different organizational contexts. In addition, they invited all participants to explore the **[Gamifica BB Portal](https://gamifica.apps.bb.com.br)**, which brings together information, practices, and initiatives focused on the strategic use of gamification.
