Brasília, September 4, 2025  

In the **Introduction to Gamification** class (09/03), we welcomed the **Gamification Team – Innovation and Culture Division of Ditec, Banco do Brasil**.  

The lecture *“Gamification at Banco do Brasil: history, methodology, and ethics”* presented how the institution structured this practice, addressing conceptual and methodological aspects, as well as the ethical dilemmas of using gamification.  

The event strengthened the integration between academic training and gamification practices applied in the market.
