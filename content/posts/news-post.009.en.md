**Mylena Faria, a Software Engineering student and fellow of the Canal Ciência project at CEDIS, travels to present project paper in Vietnam.** 

Mylena Faria, a Software Engineering student and fellow of the {{< link-interno "/projects/canal_ciencia" "Canal Ciência project" >}} at CEDIS, represented the project team at the _24th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications_ (ICCSA 2024), held in Vietnam.

The paper, titled _A process to identify players' motivational profiles for designing a gamification project_, was developed by members of the Canal Ciência project. It presents an innovative process to identify motivational profiles of target audiences in gamification projects. The research uses the Octalysis framework, proposing a personalized and adaptable approach to enhance the effectiveness of gamification. This process was tested on the Canal Ciência portal, a Brazilian government initiative aimed at engaging Brazilian students in scientific learning.

Canal Ciência, maintained by the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), aims to promote access to scientific and technological information in Brazil. The gamification of the portal seeks to make learning more engaging and interactive, especially for young students. The IBICT funds the project through Finatec.

Mylena Faria was selected to present the paper at the conference, and her participation was funded by the Canal Ciência project, reinforcing CEDIS’s commitment to promoting international scientific dissemination. "It was a great opportunity to share the team’s work with specialists from various parts of the world, showing how technology and gamification can transform education and scientific dissemination," said Mylena.
