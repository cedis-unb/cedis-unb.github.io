**The new e-book, featuring contributions from UnB experts, discusses teaching-learning methods based on qualitative indicators.**

Prof. {{< link-interno "/people/cristiane_ramos" "Cristiane Ramos" >}} and Prof. {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}}, both researchers at the Center for Studies, Development, and Innovation in Software (CEDIS) and members of the [A3M Program](http://a3m.unb.br/), along with professors Dianne Magalhães, Eduardo Bessa, and Márcia Mortari, also members of A3M, have released the e-book "Learning Indicators." Published by the University of Brasília on July 20, 2023, the book marks an important advancement in the evaluation of innovative educational projects, reflecting the authors' dedication and expertise in the educational field.

The work is the result of extensive research and collaboration among academics from various fields and brings a pioneering approach to using quality indicators to measure the success of teaching-learning strategies. The book's synopsis emphasizes its goal to encourage and guide the use of these indicators, demonstrating the positive outcomes of innovative educational methods.

The content of the book is divided into several sections, starting with a detailed introduction followed by chapters that explore indicators based on neuroscientific knowledge. Topics covered include the acquisition of new concepts, the enrichment of the neural connection network, student motivation, peer assessment, and the use of grades and evaluative activities as learning tools.

During the virtual launch ceremony, Prof. Ramos highlighted: "This book is an effort to unite theory and practice, providing educators with concrete tools to assess and improve the quality of teaching." In turn, Prof. Freitas emphasized the importance of the work: "We are facing a paradigmatic change in education, and this book is a guide to navigating this new scenario."

The book is now available for download on the University of Brasília's portal, promising to be essential reading for educators, researchers, and everyone involved in the field of education and active learning methodologies.
