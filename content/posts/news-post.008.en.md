In an academic exchange between the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) and the Center for Studies, Development, and Innovation in Software (CEDIS) at the University of Brasília (UnB), student Braz Souza stands out for his contribution in the field of educational technology. Receiving a scholarship from UFPA, Braz embarked on a one-month internship journey at CEDIS, under the guidance of Prof. {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}}, to delve into studies and research focused on gamification in educational processes.

Braz's project focused on the analysis and development of strategies for the implementation of gamification in an application previously developed by UFPA, aimed at child literacy. Through this initiative, the goal is not only to innovate but also to make learning more attractive and effective for children by leveraging the power of playful elements in education.

During his time at CEDIS, Braz not only met all expectations but also opened doors for future collaborations between the two institutions. The success of his work illustrates the potential of interinstitutional cooperation in the research and development of technological solutions aimed at social well-being.

Prof. Benedito Jesus Pinheiro Ferreira, Braz's advisor at UFPA, expressed enthusiasm for the results achieved and the importance of such exchanges for the academic and professional growth of students, as well as for the advancement of educational technology in Brazil.

This exchange reinforces the commitment of CEDIS, UnB, and UFPA to innovation and collaborative research, highlighting the importance of integration between universities for the development of projects that have the potential to transform education.
