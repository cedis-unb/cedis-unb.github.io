Welcome to the "IHC Journey," an innovative teaching project led by Prof. Sergio Freitas in the Human-Computer Interaction course at the University of Brasília. This unique project incorporates RPG-style gamification using the Octalysis model to transform learning into a captivating and deeply educational experience. Through immersion in challenges and adventures, students develop crucial skills while exploring the fundamentals of HCI, preparing them not only for academic excellence but also for success in their future professional careers.

# About the Project
The "IHC Journey" adopts an innovative pedagogical approach, integrating gamification into the Human-Computer Interaction course curriculum. Led by Prof. Sergio Freitas, this project involves students in an RPG that simulates real-world challenges and scenarios in the field, encouraging the practical application of theoretical concepts. The methodology promotes not only active student engagement but also the development of skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, and creative problem-solving, uniquely preparing them for the job market.

# Available Resources
The "IHC Journey" project offers various technological resources to enrich the students' learning experience. They have access to a mobile app developed in MS Power Apps, a Sharepoint site to centralize information, and a thematic player's guide, facilitating immersion in the RPG. All these resources are integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform, providing a fluid and interactive learning experience.

# Objectives and Benefits
The "IHC Journey" aims to provide an immersive and interactive educational experience, using gamification to engage students in the Human-Computer Interaction course. By integrating RPG elements, the project seeks not only to facilitate the understanding of fundamental HCI concepts but also to promote skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving. The benefits are significant, including increased student engagement, better comprehension of the content, and effective preparation for professional challenges in the technology field.
