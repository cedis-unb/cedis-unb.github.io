## Project Description

Under the guidance of researchers {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}} and {{< link-interno "/people/cristiane_ramos" "Cristiane Ramos" >}}, this project aims to enhance the user experience of Canal Ciência. By employing advanced gamification techniques, we propose a more engaging and motivating approach to scientific dissemination.

## Project Objectives

The core objectives of this project are multiple:
1. Identify the target audience of Canal Ciência;
2. Develop motivational profiles with the help of the Octalysis tool;
3. Establish indicators to evaluate user satisfaction and motivation; and
4. Implement gamification on the Canal Ciência Portal.

An important aspect is the rigorous evaluation of the gamified version of Canal Ciência, aiming to measure its impact on the user experience and the effectiveness of scientific content dissemination through the use of gamification.

## Methodology and Implementation

The implementation of this initiative will take place on the WordPress platform, the current base of Canal Ciência. Gamification techniques will be carefully integrated, and their effectiveness monitored through specific indicators created by the CEDIS team. This will allow continuous adjustments and enhancements to the project.

## Results and Publications

The results of this project have led to the publication of key academic works:
1. **A Process to Identify Players’ Motivational Profiles for Designing a Gamification Project**: This article presents a new process for defining motivational profiles, leveraging three strategies—assessment by judges, game dynamics, and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The process is applied to Canal Ciência to engage Brazilian students in science. [DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-64608-9_4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-64608-9_4).
2. **Crafting Personalized Learning Environments Through Motivational Profiling**: This study explores how motivational profiles tailored to different age groups can personalize learning environments, enhancing engagement and educational outcomes. The research involved over 580 participants and analyzed how gamification strategies could be tailored to meet user needs. (To appear, 2024).
