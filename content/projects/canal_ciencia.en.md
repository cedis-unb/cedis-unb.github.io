## Project Description

Under the guidance of researchers {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "Sergio Freitas" >}} and {{< link-interno "/people/cristiane_ramos" "Cristiane Ramos" >}}, the project enhanced the user experience of Canal Ciência. By employing advanced gamification techniques, a more engaging and motivating approach to scientific dissemination was proposed.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:
1. Identify the target audience of Canal Ciência;
2. Develop motivational profiles using the Octalysis tool;
3. Establish indicators to evaluate user satisfaction and motivation; and
4. Implement gamification on the Canal Ciência Portal.

A rigorous evaluation of the gamified version of Canal Ciência was conducted, measuring its impact on the user experience and the effectiveness of scientific content dissemination through gamification.

## Methodology and Implementation

The implementation took place on the WordPress platform, the current base of Canal Ciência. The gamification techniques were carefully integrated, and their effectiveness was monitored through specific indicators created by the CEDIS team, allowing continuous adjustments and improvements throughout the project.

## Results and Publications

The results of this project led to the publication of significant academic works:
1. **A Process to Identify Players’ Motivational Profiles for Gamification Projects**: This paper presented a new process to define motivational profiles, using three strategies—evaluation by judges, game dynamics, and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The process was applied to Canal Ciência to engage Brazilian students in science. [DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-64608-9_4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-64608-9_4).
2. **Crafting Personalized Learning Environments Through Motivational Profiling**: This study explored how motivational profiles, adjusted for different age groups, can personalize learning environments, improving engagement and educational outcomes. The research involved over 580 participants and analyzed how gamification strategies were adapted to meet user needs. (To appear, 2024).
