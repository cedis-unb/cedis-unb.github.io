# Project Introduction
Welcome to the Dawn of Feudalism, an educational innovation by CEDIS at the University of Brasília. Led by Professor Sergio Freitas, this teaching project transforms the Software Development course into a gamified journey, inspired by the richness and challenges of a feudal scenario. Using the Octalysis model to create a highly immersive experience, Dawn of Feudalism engages students with practical software challenges and fosters critical thinking and collaboration skills. In an environment where education blends with adventure, every student becomes a key part of an evolving narrative, preparing them not only for academic challenges but also for success in their future software engineering careers.

# About the Project
"Dawn of Feudalism" is a pioneering teaching project within the Software Development course, led by Dr. Sergio Freitas at the University of Brasília. Embracing a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach, it incorporates gamification to make education an interactive and engaging experience. Students dive into a feudal-era inspired scenario, assuming dynamic roles such as dukes and knights, to tackle practical software development challenges. This methodology enhances technical learning and essential skills like critical thinking, teamwork, and decision-making. Through this playful experience, students are uniquely prepared for real-world challenges in software, deepening engagement and practical application of theoretical knowledge.

# Available Resources
The "Dawn of Feudalism" project offers a range of advanced technological resources to enhance students' learning experiences. It includes a mobile app developed in MS Power Apps, acting as the game's main interface for interacting with the feudal scenario and managing fiefdoms. A SharePoint site centralizes information, educational resources, and student support. Power BI dashboards provide detailed analyses of player progress and fiefdoms. Additionally, a thematic player guide helps navigate the game, with all these resources integrated into the Microsoft 365 platform, ensuring a seamless learning experience.

# Objectives and Benefits
"Dawn of Feudalism" aims to provide an immersive learning experience, using gamification to teach software development in a practical and engaging way. Objectives include developing technical programming skills, fostering critical thinking, promoting effective teamwork, and improving decision-making ability. The benefits for students are significant: increased engagement with content, preparation for real-world software industry challenges, and a dynamic learning experience that encourages creativity and problem-solving.
