Welcome to the "Feudal Dawn" project, a pedagogical innovation from CEDIS at the University of Brasília. Led by Professor {{< link-interno "/people/sergio_freitas" "sergio_freitas" >}}, this gamified initiative in the Software Development discipline proposes learning based on challenges from the feudal scenario. Employing the Octalysis model, it creates an engaging experience that not only captivates students with real software problems but also develops crucial skills like strategic thinking and cooperation, preparing them for professional success in software engineering.

# About the Project
"Feudal Dawn" represents a revolutionary pedagogical approach in the Software Development discipline, under the guidance of Dr. Sergio Freitas. Using a Project-Based Learning (PBL) strategy and gamification elements, the project immerses students in a feudal context, where they assume strategic roles to overcome software challenges. This method not only enhances technical skills but also stimulates critical thinking, collaborative work, and decision-making capacity, uniquely preparing students for the job market.

# Available Resources
"Feudal Dawn" offers cutting-edge technological resources to enhance learning. Students have access to a mobile app via MS Power Apps, a SharePoint site for information centralization, Power BI dashboards for progress tracking, and a thematic guide for navigating the game. These tools, integrated with Microsoft 365, facilitate a cohesive and interactive educational experience.

# Objectives and Benefits
The project aims to provide an immersive educational experience, leveraging gamification to teach software development dynamically. It seeks to cultivate technical skills, analytical thinking, effective collaboration, and decision-making. Students benefit from increased engagement, preparation for professional challenges, and a learning method that encourages innovation and problem-solving.

# How to Participate/Contribute
Those interested in participating or contributing to "Feudal Dawn," whether as a student, teacher, or partner, can contact Prof. Sergio Freitas via email at [sergiofreitas@unb.br](mailto:sergiofreitas@unb.br). It is an opportunity to engage in a cutting-edge educational initiative and contribute to the development of the field.
