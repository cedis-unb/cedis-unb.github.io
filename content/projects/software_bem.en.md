## Welcome to “Software for Good (SpB),” a social impact initiative at the University of Brasília

Launched on September 23, 2020, during the 20th University Week at the University of Brasília (UnB), Software for Good (SpB) is a proposal to establish a collective—a community of people and organizations, meanings, actions, solutions, feelings, and energies aligned to generate good through digital technology (specifically, software). Anchored at the Center for Studies, Development, and Innovation in Software (CEDIS) of the School of Sciences and Engineering Technologies (FCTE/UnB) and coordinated by professor George Marsicano, SpB’s mission is to develop digital solutions with positive social impact, at no cost to the end user, integrating areas such as software engineering, health, education, advertising, and social services.

Through the articulation of diverse forms of knowledge and collaborative work with public and private institutions, the program aims to promote citizenship, empowerment, and social transformation through technology.

## About the program

SpB emerges as a response to the need to connect technological innovation with real social demands. Inspired by practical experiences such as the DOARTI project—developed during the COVID-19 pandemic—the program proposes the creation of an ecosystem for developing social software, supported by multidisciplinary teams and a network of internal and external partnerships at the University of Brasília.

### Its mission is:
- To align and inspire people and organizations to do good.

### Its purpose is:
- To generate positive social impact, free of charge to the end user, through the development of software combined with other multidisciplinary actions in areas such as social services, health, education, and public communication.

### Its values are:
- Transformation  
- Citizenship  
- Dignity  
- Trust  
- Empowerment

### Its goals are:
- To develop software-based solutions with positive social impact  
- To build a sustainable network of aligned people and organizations (internal and external to UnB) willing to contribute to the community (local, regional, national, global)  
- To generate innovation, technologies, and scientific evidence aimed at improving social quality of life  
- To contribute to the (human and technical) education of UnB students  
- To strengthen (identity, resources, teams, organization) and connect the set of actions and projects associated with SpB

## Associated projects

### DOARTI
Emerging in the context of the pandemic, DOARTI created a digital platform for mapping and connecting charitable organizations with potential donors in the Federal District. With an app and website already in operation, the project supports 21 social initiatives and strengthens solidarity networks. It is developed entirely by volunteers and involves students and professionals from various fields.

### LEPIC
Focused on education, LEPIC aims to develop a tool for assessing and monitoring children's reading fluency. The project is a result of a partnership between UnB (FCTE and FCTS) and UFMG, and it supports public literacy policies based on accessible technology and scientific evidence.

## Benefits and sustainability

SpB provides significant benefits both to society and to the university. Society gains from free digital solutions that directly improve quality of life, education, and inclusion. The university strengthens its outreach mission by enabling students to participate in real, interdisciplinary projects with public relevance—generating publications, internships, and transformative practical experiences.

To ensure sustainability, the program includes strategies for obtaining funding through public calls and partnerships, as well as a shared team model across projects, optimizing human resources and use of available funds.
