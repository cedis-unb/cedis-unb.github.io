 Abstract
 &lt;/button&gt;
 
 &lt;div x-show="open" class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak&gt;
 &lt;span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm"&gt;This article proposes a pedagogical approach to teaching Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Software Engineering by combining heuristic evaluation, gamification, and project-based learning. Using questionnaires, statistical analysis, prototyping, and user validation, the method—based on the Octalysis framework—proved effective in improving interface quality and student engagement through educational (Role-Playing Game) RPG elements.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
