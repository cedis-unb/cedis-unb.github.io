                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student&#39;s departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB&#39;s academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The adoption of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in the implementation of services and microservices in distributed system applications facilitates the use of development standards, maintenance, flexibility in service development, and interoperability between services and systems. The Computing Center (CPD) of the University of Brasília (UnB) engages in various software automation processes, ranging from the maintenance of existing systems to the development and deployment of new technological solutions. Continuous monitoring of the performance of services, microservices, and systems becomes crucial. This study, of an exploratory nature, aims to investigate solutions and tools for implementing and managing the monitoring of distributed services and systems at UnB, through systematic mapping. The research was theoretically grounded to develop a model that was applied to the monitoring module of the UnB service bus. Simulations were conducted with the developed solution, allowing the analysis of the integration between the service bus and the proposed monitoring tool.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">This work introduces the NatVI framework, focusing on the integration between Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Agile Development, and Quality Assurance (QA). Developed from a literature review that identified and evaluated the trade-offs between SOA and agile methods, NatVI aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the software development cycle, especially for service-based applications. It includes best practices from SOA and agile principles, emphasizing the importance of QA, essential for software projects in dynamic business environments. A case study in a unit of the Brazilian federal government assessed the application of NatVI, observing improvements in software quality, understanding of agile methods, and client satisfaction with the development process. The study also highlighted limitations, such as the size of the IT team and the number of clients involved, leading to a subjective evaluation through semi-structured interviews. The preliminary results suggest that NatVI has potential, but also highlight the need for further research, paving the way for future studies on emerging technologies, such as containers and DevOps.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The gamification of non-playful activities has gained traction in the industrial, service, and educational sectors, demonstrating that introducing game elements into an environment can make activities more engaging, fun, and enjoyable. This approach has proven to be an effective strategy for motivating and involving individuals, recognized as a valuable tool for managers. In the context of the Military Police of the Federal District, which is responsible for overt policing and maintaining public order in the nation&#39;s capital, Intelligence Activity plays a crucial role in supporting strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This study introduces the Gamified Intelligence Reporting Process (GIRP), developed for the Military Police Intelligence System. The gamification model was based on the Octalysis framework, supplemented by statistical techniques derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and document analyses. The aim of the GIRP is to improve the quality of intelligence reports through gamification, benefiting from an iterative evaluation and planning process. Additionally, the work provides a theoretical foundation on gamification, Intelligence Activity, Public Security, and an overview of the Military Police of the Federal District.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">This project aims to present the implementation of an application for the gamified discipline of Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Brasília (UnB). Gamificationis an approach that uses game elements to engage and motivate students in their learning process. The developed application aims to complement the experience of the HCIdiscipline by offering gamified features and functionalities that promote active student participation. To achieve this goal, methods and concepts from Software Engineering were employed, including the study of relevant literature on RPGs and the Octalysisframework, requirements gathering, as well as Scrum. This project presents the requirements elicitation, prioritization, and technical specifications of the system implemented inthe Final Project 2. Additionally, the development architecture defining the technologiesand environment in which the system was developed is presented, along with a proof-ofconcept including the prototype screens with some of the functionalities using the chosentechnology, and the relational modeling of entities and data. Finally, the implementationof the application is presented, along with a summary of the development process and the conclusion obtained.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.</span>

This thesis aims to explore the current state of research in the field, seeking to understand the main factors associated with academic dropout and how they can be applied in predictive models of dropout. A quantitative, exploratory, and explanatory applied research was conducted, using case study techniques and bibliographic research. The systematic literature review indicated that dropout could be predicted by academic, demographic, and learning factors. Using these factors, predictive models were developed with the help of machine learning algorithms, whose predictions proved sensitive to changes in course flows. It concludes that academic, demographic, and learning factors are effective in predicting dropout, with the selection and application method of these factors being crucial for achieving accurate predictive results. Moreover, the application of academic factors in predictive models requires consideration of the specific context of the analyzed data.</span>

In this work, the practice of gamification in the usability evaluation process is addressed. The usability-oriented gamification design process is particular to each application environment and user group. Bearing in mind that gamification projects, in general, have positive results, even if they address different objectives in relation to engagement and motivation. Taking this into account, this work presents the application of a gamified software product that aims to engage and motivate undergraduate students to study usability criteria. The methodology of systematic literature review was used for the theoretical basis for the development of the gamified application called Pixel. The application of Pixel in a human-computer interaction class generated data and information, which were used in the evaluation and analysis of motivation, engagement and use of usability criteria by students.</span>

This thesis aims to explore the current state of research in the field, seeking to understand the main factors associated with academic dropout and how they can be applied in predictive models of dropout. A quantitative, exploratory, and explanatory applied research was conducted, using case study techniques and bibliographic research. The systematic literature review indicated that dropout could be predicted by academic, demographic, and learning factors. Using these factors, predictive models were developed with the help of machine learning algorithms, whose predictions proved sensitive to changes in course flows. It concludes that academic, demographic, and learning factors are effective in predicting dropout, with the selection and application method of these factors being crucial for achieving accurate predictive results. Moreover, the application of academic factors in predictive models requires consideration of the specific context of the analyzed data.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Currently, individuals are spending an increasing amount of time using devices connected to the internet, making it a challenge to capture and maintain the attention of a specific audience. Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users&#39; views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The usage of software has grown as computers become popular. There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform&#39;s usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Employees are the main assets of software organizations and the software industry is characterized by frequent technological changes, which entail a continuous flow of new knowledge. Due to the volume of knowledge, software organizations have problems in identifying the content, location and use of knowledge, that is, difficulty in managing this knowledge. The Experiment Factory can be considered to represent the knowledge management initiative. A basic step inside the Experiment Factory is the experience base. The purpose of this work is the abstraction of the process of building a experience base for R &amp; D laboratories, inserted in the context of Software Engineering teaching of a Brazilian public university, and that do not have a defined knowledge management process. To do this, was executed a case study in two R &amp; D laboratories - ITRAC (Information Technology and Research Center) and LFS (Software Factory Laboratory), idealized from the need to create an environment that proposes to students, Experiences related to the development of software, processes and methodologies in this area. The implementation of the experience bases for R &amp; D laboratories could be realized based on a process of structuring the base of experiments, within an Experiment Factory model that has been adapted to the context of R &amp; D laboratories. The process adopted fulfills the objective of the work, since through it, was possible to build a base of experiences to maintain the knowledge generated by the objects of study. With this, the OwnCloud tool has become the experience base of the ITRAC and LFS R &amp; D laboratories.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In the context of distance education (DE), which has been experiencing global expansion, one of the most significant challenges is the scalability of evaluating essay questions. This challenge impacts the efficiency of tutors and the quality of feedback provided to students, as grading such questions requires considerable time. To address this issue, a support system for pre-evaluation was developed, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automate the assignment of preliminary grades to student responses. The proposed system is divided into two main parts - the first applies semantic similarity algorithms to compare student responses with provided answer keys; the second part is a web interface that facilitates the registration of questions and answer keys, submission of responses by students, and allows the tutor to evaluate the responses. The accuracy of the system is continuously improved through tutor feedback, enabling ML to adjust the evaluation criteria as needed. The system was tested in the course on the fundamentals of computer architecture, where it demonstrated the ability to assign meaningful grades to student responses and revealed an improvement in the accuracy of evaluations based on tutor feedback. It is concluded that the pre-evaluation support system offers a promising solution to the challenges faced in evaluating essay questions in DE environments, enhancing the scalability of the grading process and the quality of feedback provided, with potential for application across various fields of knowledge.</span>

The system serves as the gateway for all users wishing to utilize these indicator metrics. It is important to note that this is a web system. The development of this system involved a literature review on software engineering concepts, particularly development methodologies, as well as the execution of activities for requirements elicitation, development, and prioritization, along with the modeling of needs for the system&#39;s development. In the first phase, the planning of all actions necessary for the SAMI project was carried out, especially modeling, prototyping, and prioritizing requirements. With this data collected, it was possible to move to the next phase, which is implementation and testing.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Behavioral competencies relate to knowledge, attitudes and non-technical skills associated to the social, personal and cognitive areas. Behavioral competencies are as important as technical skills regarding the success of any software project. Many times, these skills are strongly linked to the achievement of tasks performed by software engineers. Some ways of developing these skills are related to personal exposure to new challenges and situations. The Science Without Borders (CSF) is a program which aims, among other objectives, to encourage, practice and develop non-technical skills in the Brazilians science students. The graduation in Software Engineering is one of the Brazilian courses that can make use of this program. However, what are the real benefits related to behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students who participate in CSF academic exchange project? The present document aims to answer this question by mapping the essential behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students and verifying how the CsF affects them. The verification of how former FGAs Software Engineering students observe the development of these type of competencies was obtained by a survey. According to the results of this project, the students believe that not only do they communicate better in portuguese, but also in different languages, theyve acquired a better critical thinking ability, also theyre more responsible and sensible to different cultures. Summarizing it, in their perspectives the CSF experience gave the support to the development oF some important behavioral competencies expected for a software engineer.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Motivation is the driving force that leads people to achieve goals, objectives, or solve problems. This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The use of software has been increasingly popular in society, including in virtual learning environments. As technology advances, pedagogical methods have evolved, giving rise to new approaches aimed at leveraging these advancements to enhance teaching and learning processes. This study introduces the adaptation of a virtual learning environment for teaching algorithms, employing Gamification techniques as proposed by Yu-kai Chou, in conjunction with the educational strategies developed by Salman Khan. The virtual learning environment Moodle was used to structure a fully gamified course on algorithms, supported by the software Funifier and Scratch. The online course, lasting one month, is structured into weekly tasks that cover the basic concepts of computational algorithms, incorporating established gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards, aiming to effectively engage and motivate students.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">This work aims to evaluate the deployment of a Service Desk tool for IT service management in a public organization, aligning with its strategic objectives, daily operations, organizational needs, and the ITIL v3 infrastructure library. IT services are crucial for organizational activities, with management applications being integral for client access to these services. In the public sector, the increasing demand for quality service delivery emphasizes the importance of effective IT management applications to adapt to constant IT changes. The study identifies the lack of proper IT service management or flawed management as a source of service availability issues, resource overallocation, and negative impacts on IT&#39;s reputation. It focuses on the Ministry &#34;A&#34; scenario, highlighting the necessity for an effective IT Service Management tool, OTRS, based on Incident Management processes to improve the IT Governance Index (iGovTI). This End Graduation Work seeks to assess the implementation process of OTRS and its potential to enhance IT Service Management governance.</span>

                    <span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The quest for information originated from libraries, where it was possible to retrieve necessary data through consultations using catalog cards, organizing books by title, author, year, or publisher. With technological advancements, this process was automated, allowing these tasks to be performed on computers. However, due to the vast volume of available information, efficiently finding specific information can be challenging, making the search process exhaustive and complex. To address this issue, there are studies and implementations concerning the sorting of retrieved information. It is also relevant to apply techniques for customized queries based on criteria defined by users. This work aims to analyze the effectiveness of dynamic and static algorithms in sorting retrieved information, exploring the customization of queries in open-source search engines. We will evaluate which algorithm offers greater accuracy, using precision x recall metrics, which allow for a degree of customization in queries, including user profiles from the four engineering courses at the University of Brasília  Faculdade do Gama, and how software engineering can enhance the sorting and retrieval of information.</span>
