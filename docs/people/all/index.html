Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student's departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB's academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Arthur Rocha Temporim de Lacerda,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Chatbot development frameworks provide a range of construction methods; however, established processes like the Chatbot Management Process (CMP) often lack activities specifically tailored to enhance user engagement. This thesis presents the Gamified Chatbot Management Process (GCMP), an extension of the CMP that integrates and adapts activities to boost user interaction with chatbots. Three iterations of the GCMP were created, each incorporating enhancements driven by the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology. This iterative approach supported the continuous evaluation and evolution of the process. Experiments with real users indicated positive engagement, with all participants successfully meeting the set objectives. Furthermore, the average deployment time was reduced by 66% from the initial to the final version. User assessments also gave top ratings for the quality of responses generated by the chatbot. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCMP. The findings suggest a strong positive correlation between implementing the GCMP and improvements in developing gamified chatbots. The advances in both chatbot functionality and gamification techniques highlight the potential for widespread adoption of the GCMP as a reliable and effective approach for creating gamified chatbots.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Luciana Santos de Assis,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Públio Pastrolin Cavalcante,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The gamification of non-playful activities has gained traction in the industrial, service, and educational sectors, demonstrating that introducing game elements into an environment can make activities more engaging, fun, and enjoyable. This approach has proven to be an effective strategy for motivating and involving individuals, recognized as a valuable tool for managers. In the context of the Military Police of the Federal District, which is responsible for overt policing and maintaining public order in the nation's capital, Intelligence Activity plays a crucial role in supporting strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This study introduces the Gamified Intelligence Reporting Process (GIRP), developed for the Military Police Intelligence System. The gamification model was based on the Octalysis framework, supplemented by statistical techniques derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and document analyses. The aim of the GIRP is to improve the quality of intelligence reports through gamification, benefiting from an iterative evaluation and planning process. Additionally, the work provides a theoretical foundation on gamification, Intelligence Activity, Public Security, and an overview of the Military Police of the Federal District.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ana Cláudia Alves Mendes Araújo,

However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Taylor Rodrigues Lopes,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Currently, most organizations depend on Information Systems. In general, these systems are built based on monolithic architecture, with centralized execution on a single server. Over the years, however, the constant changes to meet business needs and the accumulation of technical debt, have made these systems increasingly larger and complex, making aspects such as maintainability and scalability difficult. This difficult reality experienced by many organizations motivated the present work to investigate a new architectural trend called microservices. Popularized by companies like Netflix and Amazon, microservices can be an alternative for the modernization of legacy systems, providing low downtime and imperceptible impact to the end user. In this new architecture, the software is broken down into small parts that work independently and autonomously, bringing some improvements in terms of software quality attributes. However, there are also challenges and tradeoffs - adopting microservices tends to be a difficult process and not rarely unsuccessful, mainly due to the lack of methods to conduct the migration process. In this sense, based on scientific studies, this work presents a migration method entitled Microservice Full Cycle - MFC, inspired by the software development life cycle and DevOps strategies. The goal is to assist legacy software systems to gradually evolve guided by a set of steps and activities common to the microservice architecture. The validation of the MFC method is done through an experiment in a real application, showing advantages such as more cohesive and uncoupled codes, technological independence, agility in build, test and deploy (automation), scalability under high demand, greater interoperability and integration, geodistributed capabilities, plus realtime monitoring and feedback.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Felipe Evangelista dos Santos,

Developed from a literature review that identified and evaluated the trade-offs between SOA and agile methods, NatVI aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the software development cycle, especially for service-based applications. It includes best practices from SOA and agile principles, emphasizing the importance of QA, essential for software projects in dynamic business environments. A case study in a unit of the Brazilian federal government assessed the application of NatVI, observing improvements in software quality, understanding of agile methods, and client satisfaction with the development process. The study also highlighted limitations, such as the size of the IT team and the number of clients involved, leading to a subjective evaluation through semi-structured interviews. The preliminary results suggest that NatVI has potential, but also highlight the need for further research, paving the way for future studies on emerging technologies, such as containers and DevOps.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Débora Zupeli Bossois,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">With the ongoing expansion of electronic textual content, there's a need to organize all this information in a manageable way. Hence, the process of text categorization was developed to ease the manipulation and retrieval of information by dividing it into thematic categories. There are various approaches to achieving an automatic text categorizer, among which the supervised paradigm is the most traditional. Although supervised methodology shows precision comparable to human experts, the requirement for a pre-classified corpus can be a limiting factor in some applications. In these cases, a semi or unsupervised solution, which doesn't demand a complete and well-formed training set for categorizer construction, can be applied; instead, unlabeled documents are provided to the method. Both supervised learning paradigms and semi or unsupervised paradigms typically build a representation of texts based solely on term occurrence, not considering semantic factors. However, many intrinsic characteristics of natural language can make the process ambiguous, one of which is the use of various terms to refer to an entity already mentioned in the text, a linguistic phenomenon known as anaphora. This dissertation proposes a method for the conception of an unsupervised categorizer, utilizing the Nominal Structure of Discourse (NSD), developed by Freitas for anaphora resolution, as a foundation. For this purpose, a bootstrapping technique for categorization is implemented, aiming to obtain initial labeling for documents, which is used to generate a categorization model through the supervised paradigm. Besides being based on the NSD, the methodology of this work benefits directly from the anaphora resolution process, using the identified antecedents for anaphoras during the final categorization phase. This work presents details about the proposed methodology, explaining the developed algorithms, as well as the experiments conducted for method evaluation. Results show that the use of the anaphora resolution process is beneficial for an unsupervised categorization system.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Luana Vieira Morellato,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Phrases, or syntagms, are units of meaning with syntactic functions within a sentence, as described by Nicola (2008). Generally, the sentences in any statement express content through the elements and combinations thereof provided by the language. This process forms sets and subsets that act as syntactic units within the larger unit of the sentence—syntagms, which can be categorized into nominal and verbal. Among these, nominal syntagms are of particular interest due to their higher semantic value. They are employed in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as anaphora resolution, automatic ontology building, parsing in medical texts for summary generation and vocabulary creation, or as an initial step in syntactic analysis processes. In Information Retrieval (IR), syntagms can be used to create terms in document indexing and search systems, improving results. This dissertation presents a computational methodology for identifying nominal syntagms in Portuguese language digital documents. It outlines the methodology for identifying and extracting nominal syntagms through the development of SISNOP—System for Identifying Nominal Syntagms in Portuguese. SISNOP, comprising a set of modules and programs, interprets unrestricted texts in natural language through morphological and syntactic analyses to retrieve nominal syntagms, also providing syntactic information such as gender, number, and degree of words within the extracted syntagms. Tested on corpora like CETENFolha and CETEMPúblico, SISNOP recognized 98.12% and 94.59% of sentences, identifying over 24 million syntagms. Its modules—Morphological Tagger, Nominal Syntagms Identifier, and Gender, Number, and Degree Identifier—were individually tested using a smaller dataset due to manual result analysis, achieving a precision of 82.45% and coverage of 69.20%.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Francisco Santiago do Carmo Pereira,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">This dissertation presents a novel digital text search methodology grounded in the Nominal Structure of Discourse, expanding on anaphora resolution techniques proposed by Freitas [2005]. It employs these techniques to reveal the textual structure designed by authors, offering a unique approach to Information Retrieval (IR). Traditional IR models, like the vector space model and Latent Semantic Indexing, primarily use document terms for representation and search, often failing to account for the nuances of natural language, such as the use of anaphoras. These linguistic features can diminish the representational efficacy of classical models by complicating the identification of key entities within texts. To address these limitations, an alternative structural model that incorporates anaphora resolution into its computational representation of documents is introduced, based on Seibel Júnior's work [Seibel Júnior and Freitas, 2007]. This model, which focuses on the Discourse Nominal Structure for Searches (DNSS), aims to improve upon existing IR methodologies by ensuring a more nuanced and effective representation of documents. It does so by identifying and utilizing the central elements, or focuses, of text sentences, while also considering additional information provided by the Nominal Structure of Discourse (NSD). The dissertation elaborates on the development of this search structure, detailing the anaphora resolution process and its impact on enhancing the representation and search result quality of documents. Through the exploration of algorithms and experimentation, the study underscores the potential of this new methodology in advancing the field of Information Retrieval.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Hilário Seibel Júnior,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) methods are primarily based on counting the frequency of word occurrences in a document, without offering solutions for interpreting the semantic content of the discourse [Van Rijsbergen 1979; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto 1999]. By not interpreting the analyzed document, such methods may overlook important information about it. A solution to overcome this issue, mentioned in [Salton and McGill 1986], is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) in information retrieval. One application of NLP is the processing of anaphoras. Anaphora [Carter 1987; Beaver 2004] is a linguistic phenomenon where an entity introduced a priori is referenced later in another sentence through some linguistic expression, as in "Valentina was born in São Paulo. The girl is a Pisces." Anaphora resolution identifies that the term "girl" in the second sentence references the entity introduced in the discourse by the term "Valentina" from the first sentence. This allows us to assert that Valentina is more relevant to the text than if such reference had not occurred. Freitas proposes in [Freitas 2005] a method to resolve anaphoras in a document by creating a structure that allows tracking entities that remain prominent throughout the discourse. This structure stores information that can be leveraged by an information retrieval method. This dissertation proposes a computational methodology to retrieve relevant information from the resolution of anaphoras in a document, aiming to improve the quality of query results. Anaphora resolution enables precise identification of the number of times each entity is referenced in a discourse, revealing entities and connections that may have been obscured in the original discourse. This information makes it possible to decide whether a certain entity is more relevant than another in the document, focusing more on what the author wrote. Thus, the relevant documents retrieved are ranked by the amount of information they present regarding the searched terms, and not merely by the location and/or number of occurrences of such terms. This work also allows identifying, through the structure generated by anaphora processing, synonymous terms (those that reference the same entity). If the document indicates that two terms are synonymous, searching for one will return the same result as searching for the other, further increasing the quality of query results. This work presents the details of the proposed methodology - the measures used to calculate the relevance of a term in relation to the document interpreted through anaphora processing, the procedures necessary for conducting a query, the implemented prototype, and the analysis of its time complexity. Furthermore, the characteristics of this approach that differentiate it from traditional methods regarding the quality of the obtained results are evaluated.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ayrton Monteiro Cristo Filho,

The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Lucas Naves Cauê Oliveira,

In this work, the practice of gamification in the usability evaluation process is addressed. The usability-oriented gamification design process is particular to each application environment and user group. Bearing in mind that gamification projects, in general, have positive results, even if they address different objectives in relation to engagement and motivation. Taking this into account, this work presents the application of a gamified software product that aims to engage and motivate undergraduate students to study usability criteria. The methodology of systematic literature review was used for the theoretical basis for the development of the gamified application called Pixel. The application of Pixel in a human-computer interaction class generated data and information, which were used in the evaluation and analysis of motivation, engagement and use of usability criteria by students.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Gabriela da Gama Piveta,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Laércio Sousa Júnior,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Currently, individuals are spending an increasing amount of time using devices connected to the internet, making it a challenge to capture and maintain the attention of a specific audience. Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users' views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Leandro Alves Ferreira Santos,

There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Tiago Ribeiro de Assunção,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform's usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Yeltsin Suares Gama,

Due to the volume of knowledge, software organizations have problems in identifying the content, location and use of knowledge, that is, difficulty in managing this knowledge. The Experiment Factory can be considered to represent the knowledge management initiative. A basic step inside the Experiment Factory is the experience base. The purpose of this work is the abstraction of the process of building a experience base for R & D laboratories, inserted in the context of Software Engineering teaching of a Brazilian public university, and that do not have a defined knowledge management process. To do this, was executed a case study in two R & D laboratories - ITRAC (Information Technology and Research Center) and LFS (Software Factory Laboratory), idealized from the need to create an environment that proposes to students, Experiences related to the development of software, processes and methodologies in this area. The implementation of the experience bases for R & D laboratories could be realized based on a process of structuring the base of experiments, within an Experiment Factory model that has been adapted to the context of R & D laboratories. The process adopted fulfills the objective of the work, since through it, was possible to build a base of experiences to maintain the knowledge generated by the objects of study. With this, the OwnCloud tool has become the experience base of the ITRAC and LFS R & D laboratories.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Cristóvão de Lima Frinhani,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In the context of distance education (DE), which has been experiencing global expansion, one of the most significant challenges is the scalability of evaluating essay questions. This challenge impacts the efficiency of tutors and the quality of feedback provided to students, as grading such questions requires considerable time. To address this issue, a support system for pre-evaluation was developed, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automate the assignment of preliminary grades to student responses. The proposed system is divided into two main parts - the first applies semantic similarity algorithms to compare student responses with provided answer keys; the second part is a web interface that facilitates the registration of questions and answer keys, submission of responses by students, and allows the tutor to evaluate the responses. The accuracy of the system is continuously improved through tutor feedback, enabling ML to adjust the evaluation criteria as needed. The system was tested in the course on the fundamentals of computer architecture, where it demonstrated the ability to assign meaningful grades to student responses and revealed an improvement in the accuracy of evaluations based on tutor feedback. It is concluded that the pre-evaluation support system offers a promising solution to the challenges faced in evaluating essay questions in DE environments, enhancing the scalability of the grading process and the quality of feedback provided, with potential for application across various fields of knowledge.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">João Vitor de Moura Rosa Silva,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Behavioral competencies relate to knowledge, attitudes and non-technical skills associated to the social, personal and cognitive areas. Behavioral competencies are as important as technical skills regarding the success of any software project. Many times, these skills are strongly linked to the achievement of tasks performed by software engineers. Some ways of developing these skills are related to personal exposure to new challenges and situations. The Science Without Borders (CSF) is a program which aims, among other objectives, to encourage, practice and develop non-technical skills in the Brazilians science students. The graduation in Software Engineering is one of the Brazilian courses that can make use of this program. However, what are the real benefits related to behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students who participate in CSF academic exchange project? The present document aims to answer this question by mapping the essential behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students and verifying how the CsF affects them. The verification of how former FGAs Software Engineering students observe the development of these type of competencies was obtained by a survey. According to the results of this project, the students believe that not only do they communicate better in portuguese, but also in different languages, theyve acquired a better critical thinking ability, also theyre more responsible and sensible to different cultures. Summarizing it, in their perspectives the CSF experience gave the support to the development oF some important behavioral competencies expected for a software engineer.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ludimila da Bela Cruz,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Motivation is the driving force that leads people to achieve goals, objectives, or solve problems. This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Wilker Mesquita de Assunção,

With technological advancements, this process was automated, allowing these tasks to be performed on computers. However, due to the vast volume of available information, efficiently finding specific information can be challenging, making the search process exhaustive and complex. To address this issue, there are studies and implementations concerning the sorting of retrieved information. It is also relevant to apply techniques for customized queries based on criteria defined by users. This work aims to analyze the effectiveness of dynamic and static algorithms in sorting retrieved information, exploring the customization of queries in open-source search engines. We will evaluate which algorithm offers greater accuracy, using precision x recall metrics, which allow for a degree of customization in queries, including user profiles from the four engineering courses at the University of Brasília - Faculdade do Gama, and how software engineering can enhance the sorting and retrieval of information.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Giulia Lobo Barros,
