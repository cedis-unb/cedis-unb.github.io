Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Lucas Naves Cauê Oliveira,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The gamification of non-playful activities has gained traction in the industrial, service, and educational sectors, demonstrating that introducing game elements into an environment can make activities more engaging, fun, and enjoyable. This approach has proven to be an effective strategy for motivating and involving individuals, recognized as a valuable tool for managers. In the context of the Military Police of the Federal District, which is responsible for overt policing and maintaining public order in the nation's capital, Intelligence Activity plays a crucial role in supporting strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This study introduces the Gamified Intelligence Reporting Process (GIRP), developed for the Military Police Intelligence System. The gamification model was based on the Octalysis framework, supplemented by statistical techniques derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and document analyses. The aim of the GIRP is to improve the quality of intelligence reports through gamification, benefiting from an iterative evaluation and planning process. Additionally, the work provides a theoretical foundation on gamification, Intelligence Activity, Public Security, and an overview of the Military Police of the Federal District.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ateldy Brasil Filho,

In this work, the practice of gamification in the usability evaluation process is addressed. The usability-oriented gamification design process is particular to each application environment and user group. Bearing in mind that gamification projects, in general, have positive results, even if they address different objectives in relation to engagement and motivation. Taking this into account, this work presents the application of a gamified software product that aims to engage and motivate undergraduate students to study usability criteria. The methodology of systematic literature review was used for the theoretical basis for the development of the gamified application called Pixel. The application of Pixel in a human-computer interaction class generated data and information, which were used in the evaluation and analysis of motivation, engagement and use of usability criteria by students.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">João Vítor Lopes de Farias,

Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ana Cláudia Alves Mendes Araújo,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Weiller Fernandes Pereira,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Bruno Contessotto Bragança Pinheiro,

Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users' views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">CUNHA, GEOVÂNIA,BARRAQUI, LUCIANA,FREITAS, S.

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The usage of software has grown as computers become popular. There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Tiago Ribeiro de Assunção,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform's usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">FREITAS, S.

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The goal of this work is to design and implement a system for analyzing learning indicator metrics related to the Learning for the Third Millennium (A3M) program. The system serves as the gateway for all users wishing to utilize these indicator metrics. It is important to note that this is a web system. The development of this system involved a literature review on software engineering concepts, particularly development methodologies, as well as the execution of activities for requirements elicitation, development, and prioritization, along with the modeling of needs for the system's development. In the first phase, the planning of all actions necessary for the SAMI project was carried out, especially modeling, prototyping, and prioritizing requirements. With this data collected, it was possible to move to the next phase, which is implementation and testing.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">Ludimila da Bela Cruz,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">Motivation is the driving force that leads people to achieve goals, objectives, or solve problems. This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.</span></div></div></li><li x-data="{ open: false }">NAYARA, BRUNA,CRUZ, LUDIMILA DA BELA,FREITAS, S. A. A.,

Abstract</button><div x-show=open class="mt-2 pl-4 font-serif" x-cloak><span class="text-neutral-700 text-sm">The use of software has been increasingly popular in society, including in virtual learning environments. As technology advances, pedagogical methods have evolved, giving rise to new approaches aimed at leveraging these advancements to enhance teaching and learning processes. This study introduces the adaptation of a virtual learning environment for teaching algorithms, employing Gamification techniques as proposed by Yu-kai Chou, in conjunction with the educational strategies developed by Salman Khan. The virtual learning environment Moodle was used to structure a fully gamified course on algorithms, supported by the software Funifier and Scratch. The online course, lasting one month, is structured into weekly tasks that cover the basic concepts of computational algorithms, incorporating established gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards, aiming to effectively engage and motivate students.</span></div></div></li></ol><h3 id=apps>Apps</h3><ol><li>HCI Journey mobile - support app for the gamified Human-Computer Interaction discipline (HCI Journey), 2023.</li><li>Teodosio, Rafael Santos; $tudy - financial education for youth, 2022.</li><li>Bandeira, Érico Maximiano; Pixel - gamified site.
