Abstract Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student\u0026#39;s departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB\u0026#39;s academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.

Abstract This project aims to present the implementation of an application for the gamified discipline of Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Brasília (UnB). Gamificationis an approach that uses game elements to engage and motivate students in their learning process. The developed application aims to complement the experience of the HCIdiscipline by offering gamified features and functionalities that promote active student participation. To achieve this goal, methods and concepts from Software Engineering were employed, including the study of relevant literature on RPGs and the Octalysisframework, requirements gathering, as well as Scrum. This project presents the requirements elicitation, prioritization, and technical specifications of the system implemented inthe Final Project 2. Additionally, the development architecture defining the technologiesand environment in which the system was developed is presented, along with a proof-ofconcept including the prototype screens with some of the functionalities using the chosentechnology, and the relational modeling of entities and data. Finally, the implementationof the application is presented, along with a summary of the development process and the conclusion obtained. João Vitor Lopes de Farias, Journey - the use of RPG in a learning process , 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Active Learning . Abstract In the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.

Abstract The use of gamification in the area of human-computer interaction has become a practice to engage and motivate users. In this work, the practice of gamification in the usability evaluation process is addressed. The usability-oriented gamification design process is particular to each application environment and user group. Bearing in mind that gamification projects, in general, have positive results, even if they address different objectives in relation to engagement and motivation. Taking this into account, this work presents the application of a gamified software product that aims to engage and motivate undergraduate students to study usability criteria. The methodology of systematic literature review was used for the theoretical basis for the development of the gamified application called Pixel. The application of Pixel in a human-computer interaction class generated data and information, which were used in the evaluation and analysis of motivation, engagement and use of usability criteria by students.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Education . Abstract The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review. MOTA, V. F.

Abstract The usage of software has grown as computers become popular. There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation. MELO, L. V. S.

Abstract Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student\u0026#39;s departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB\u0026#39;s academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.

Abstract In the context of distance education (DE), which has been experiencing global expansion, one of the most significant challenges is the scalability of evaluating essay questions. This challenge impacts the efficiency of tutors and the quality of feedback provided to students, as grading such questions requires considerable time. To address this issue, a support system for pre-evaluation was developed, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automate the assignment of preliminary grades to student responses. The proposed system is divided into two main parts - the first applies semantic similarity algorithms to compare student responses with provided answer keys; the second part is a web interface that facilitates the registration of questions and answer keys, submission of responses by students, and allows the tutor to evaluate the responses. The accuracy of the system is continuously improved through tutor feedback, enabling ML to adjust the evaluation criteria as needed. The system was tested in the course on the fundamentals of computer architecture, where it demonstrated the ability to assign meaningful grades to student responses and revealed an improvement in the accuracy of evaluations based on tutor feedback. It is concluded that the pre-evaluation support system offers a promising solution to the challenges faced in evaluating essay questions in DE environments, enhancing the scalability of the grading process and the quality of feedback provided, with potential for application across various fields of knowledge.

Abstract The quest for information originated from libraries, where it was possible to retrieve necessary data through consultations using catalog cards, organizing books by title, author, year, or publisher. With technological advancements, this process was automated, allowing these tasks to be performed on computers. However, due to the vast volume of available information, efficiently finding specific information can be challenging, making the search process exhaustive and complex. To address this issue, there are studies and implementations concerning the sorting of retrieved information. It is also relevant to apply techniques for customized queries based on criteria defined by users. This work aims to analyze the effectiveness of dynamic and static algorithms in sorting retrieved information, exploring the customization of queries in open-source search engines. We will evaluate which algorithm offers greater accuracy, using precision x recall metrics, which allow for a degree of customization in queries, including user profiles from the four engineering courses at the University of Brasília  Faculdade do Gama, and how software engineering can enhance the sorting and retrieval of information.

      "content": "The strong use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) originated in the 70s, became popular in the 90s, contributing to increased consumption, improved quality of life, and well-being of people in the information society, connected by various services of both commercial and governmental natures. In this context, terms such as electronic government, e-Government, and Digital Government emerged, along with concerns about the Digital Divide, reflecting on digital inclusion/exclusion as factors impacting the social inclusion of various populations. The impacts necessitate formulating digital transformation strategies for the involved organizations and institutions.\nThe Brazilian Federal Government\u0026rsquo;s Digital Public Services Transformation project involves research, development, and innovation in methodologies, models, and tools that promote the automation and digitization of public services offered by the Ministry of Economy (ME), by the Special Secretariat for Debureaucratization, Management, and Digital Government (specifically by the Secretariat of Digital Government (SGD), aiming at the transformation of federal public services. The project was established between UnB (ITRAC Laboratory of the Faculty of Gama) and the ME.\nCEDIS Members: Prof. Dr. George Marsicano\nParticipation: Prof. Dr. George Marsicano collaborates individually with the Brazilian Federal Government\u0026rsquo;s Digital Public Services Transformation project, alongside the ITRAC Laboratory, mainly in the areas of Agile Project Management, Software Requirements, Software Engineering, and Software Development Approaches.\nAs another initiative, the ongoing doctoral project of Prof. MSc Ricardo Kosloski, discussing the impact factors associated with the area of software quality, on the use of e-Gov services by elderly people, a population continuously growing worldwide, as well as in Brazil.\nIn the Brazilian context, after a population growth peak between the 50s/60s, improvements in medicine and hygiene minimized mortality rates. Subsequently, social phenomena such as family planning, urbanization, migration flows, and the participation of women in the workforce balanced mortality and fertility rates, resulting in more modest demographic growth and consequently in the aging of the Brazilian population, following a global trend. Moreover, involving specific populations in the digital transformation process aims to give them a voice and empowerment towards achieving an e-Democracy characteristic of the information society, according to international guidelines established by works like Nothing about us, without us (CHARLTON, 2004).\nPublications and Productions Publications ERVEN, RICARDO CORDEIRO GALVÃO SANTANA VAN,DIAS, POLLYANNA C.

Abstract Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system. MARIANI, C. B.,RAMOS, J. C. C.,RODRIGUES, L. S.,KOSLOSKI, R. A. D.,FECHINE, V. M.

João Vitor Lopes de Farias, Journey - the use of RPG in a learning process , 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Active Learning . Abstract In the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.

Abstract Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system. Ana Cláudia Alves Mendes Araújo, REQGAME - Requirements Elicitation with Gamification - An Experiment in Software Projects in a Federal Public Agency . Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process. Weiller Fernandes Pereira, Systematic literature review on the use of frameworks in the construction of gamification in education . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Education . Abstract The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2018 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract Currently, individuals are spending an increasing amount of time using devices connected to the internet, making it a challenge to capture and maintain the attention of a specific audience. Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users\u0026#39; views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. CUNHA, GEOVÂNIA,BARRAQUI, LUCIANA,FREITAS, S. A.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2017 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Education, Active Learning . Abstract The usage of software has grown as computers become popular. There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation. Tiago Ribeiro de Assunção, Application of Gamification in the About Social Network . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2017 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Soft Skills . Abstract In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform\u0026#39;s usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, . Abstract Motivation is the driving force that leads people to achieve goals, objectives, or solve problems. This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.

      "title": "Software Quality",
      "content": "Software Quality constitutes a fundamental pillar in software engineering, directly reflecting on user satisfaction, operational efficiency, and the sustainability of computer systems. This concept encompasses a range of attributes and criteria that determine how well software meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders, in addition to adhering to pre-established development standards.\nTo understand Software Quality, it is essential to consider two aspects: internal quality and external quality. Internal quality refers to the inherent characteristics of the software\u0026rsquo;s code and architecture, including its readability, reusability, modularity, and the ease with which it can be maintained and evolved. These attributes are critical for the developers and maintainers of the system. On the other hand, external quality relates to the user\u0026rsquo;s experience when interacting with the software, covering aspects such as usability, performance, reliability, and security. External quality is often assessed through software testing and direct feedback from users.\nStandards and models have been developed to assist in the evaluation and assurance of software quality, among which ISO/IEC 25010:2011, also known as SQuaRE (System and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation), and CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) stand out. The ISO/IEC 25010 model, for instance, defines a set of quality characteristics, subdivided into sub-characteristics, that provide a framework for software evaluation. Such characteristics include functionality, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, and portability.\nThe implementation of software quality assurance practices is a continuous process, starting in the early stages of software conception and extending throughout its life cycle. It involves the application of agile development methodologies, continuous integration, automated testing, code reviews, and other software engineering practices aimed at identifying and correcting defects early, improving development efficiency, and ensuring that the final product meets or exceeds user expectations.\nIn summary, software quality is not an attribute that can be added after development; it must be an intrinsic consideration at every stage of the software development process. A systematic approach to quality management is crucial for delivering software products that not only function as expected but also provide a satisfactory user experience, remain relevant and evolvable in the face of market demands and technological challenges.\nPublications and Productions Publications Gabriel Carvalho, IA-QVT - A Tool for Collecting and Processing Data on Work-Life Quality, Focusing on Usability and Accessibility .

Abstract Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system. MENDES, F.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2017 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Soft Skills . Abstract In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform\u0026#39;s usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks. Attany Nathaly Lima Araújo, Process of building an experience database for R\u0026amp;D laboratories , 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Soft Skills, Teamwork . Abstract Employees are the main assets of software organizations and the software industry is characterized by frequent technological changes, which entail a continuous flow of new knowledge. Due to the volume of knowledge, software organizations have problems in identifying the content, location and use of knowledge, that is, difficulty in managing this knowledge. The Experiment Factory can be considered to represent the knowledge management initiative. A basic step inside the Experiment Factory is the experience base. The purpose of this work is the abstraction of the process of building a experience base for R \u0026amp; D laboratories, inserted in the context of Software Engineering teaching of a Brazilian public university, and that do not have a defined knowledge management process. To do this, was executed a case study in two R \u0026amp; D laboratories - ITRAC (Information Technology and Research Center) and LFS (Software Factory Laboratory), idealized from the need to create an environment that proposes to students, Experiences related to the development of software, processes and methodologies in this area. The implementation of the experience bases for R \u0026amp; D laboratories could be realized based on a process of structuring the base of experiments, within an Experiment Factory model that has been adapted to the context of R \u0026amp; D laboratories. The process adopted fulfills the objective of the work, since through it, was possible to build a base of experiences to maintain the knowledge generated by the objects of study. With this, the OwnCloud tool has become the experience base of the ITRAC and LFS R \u0026amp; D laboratories. Leandro Veloso Rodrigues, A study on the contribution of the Science Without Borders Program to the development of behavioral competencies in software engineering . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas, Fabiana Mendes . Tags: Soft Skills . Abstract Behavioral competencies relate to knowledge, attitudes and non-technical skills associated to the social, personal and cognitive areas. Behavioral competencies are as important as technical skills regarding the success of any software project. Many times, these skills are strongly linked to the achievement of tasks performed by software engineers. Some ways of developing these skills are related to personal exposure to new challenges and situations. The Science Without Borders (CSF) is a program which aims, among other objectives, to encourage, practice and develop non-technical skills in the Brazilians science students. The graduation in Software Engineering is one of the Brazilian courses that can make use of this program. However, what are the real benefits related to behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students who participate in CSF academic exchange project? The present document aims to answer this question by mapping the essential behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students and verifying how the CsF affects them. The verification of how former FGAs Software Engineering students observe the development of these type of competencies was obtained by a survey. According to the results of this project, the students believe that not only do they communicate better in portuguese, but also in different languages, theyve acquired a better critical thinking ability, also theyre more responsible and sensible to different cultures. Summarizing it, in their perspectives the CSF experience gave the support to the development oF some important behavioral competencies expected for a software engineer.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2018 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract Currently, individuals are spending an increasing amount of time using devices connected to the internet, making it a challenge to capture and maintain the attention of a specific audience. Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users\u0026#39; views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

      "title": "Green Software Development Project",
      "content": "Green Software Development Overview Software is a core component of IT. So, how can we produce more sustainable software? Indeed, there are different ways to think about sustainability in software (1) green in software, (2) green by software, and (3) green in software engineering, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Green Software and its aspects. Adapted from Calero (2015a)\nGreen by software refers to software whose domain is the preservation of the environment, for example, energy management software (Calero, 2015a). Green in software refers to how to develop software in a more sustainable way, including both software development issues and beyond, for example, strategic and governance issues (Calero, 2015a). Finally, sustainability in Software Engineering (Green in Software Engineering or Green Software Development) aims to include sustainability practices in the software development process, in other words, consider such practices as part of software development (Calero, 2015a).\nSoftware Engineering is defined as \u0026ldquo;the application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the application of engineering to software\u0026rdquo; (ISO, 2010).\nConsidering this definition, sustainability in software engineering can be summarized as the set of practices that consider environmental-related aspects (Calero, 2015a). In other words, it involves conducting all software lifecycle activities sustainably, from its conception to its retirement. This definition is illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Sustainability in Software Engineering. Adapted from (Calero, 2015a)\nOut of the 15 knowledge areas of Software Engineering presented in SWEBOK (Bourque and Fairley, 2014), Calero et al. (2019a) identified that research considering the aspect of sustainability has already been carried out in five of them: requirements, design and architecture, construction, testing, and software quality. The main focuses of these researches are on sustainable development, requirements engineering, hardware, embedded software, algorithms, big data, and mobile applications.\nDespite more than two decades of existence, concern for sustainability in software engineering has been a constant and growing target of research. However, much still needs to be studied and, more than that, many of the results of these researches still need to be applied to software development in the daily life of companies that produce software worldwide.\nA study conducted by Calero et al. (2019b) investigated the application of sustainability practices in software in ten major software-producing companies: CA Technologies, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, VMware, SAP, Symantec Corp, Apple, IBM, and Oracle. The authors did not identify the application of any practice in the green in software dimension in more than half of these companies: Microsoft, VMware, SAP, Symantec Corp, Apple, and Oracle.\nThis situation is no different in Brazil. Karita et al. (2021) conducted a survey with 99 Brazilian software professionals. Among the findings, the study found that a large part of the respondents have little knowledge related to software sustainability. Well, if the professionals are unaware of the area, certainly the application of knowledge is far from being a reality.\nTherefore, this project aims to draw attention to the need to know this area and, once we have this knowledge, to bring it to companies. In this way, we will be contributing to the construction of software that cares about the effects they produce on the environment.\nReferences Bourque, P., and Fairley, R. E., Eds.

This feature facilitates the interpretation of indicators, contributing to evidence-based management.\nA key differentiator of SAGA is its capability for trend projection, particularly regarding student dropout. The system employs analytical models to predict dropout risks, offering managers the opportunity for proactive intervention. This functionality emerges as a strategic resource, empowering institutions to develop specific action plans for student retention.\nBeyond traditional indicator monitoring, SAGA is enriched with a predictive analysis module. This module works with variables and historical patterns to provide accurate estimates, allowing for more assertive academic management. Thus, the system not only diagnoses the current scenario but also anticipates future scenarios, aiding in the formulation of more effective academic policies.\nIn summary, SAGA positions itself as an essential tool for academic managers seeking to optimize processes and improve educational outcomes.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Learning Analytics, Machine Learning . Abstract Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student\u0026#39;s departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB\u0026#39;s academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Soft Skills, Digital Transformation . Abstract Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system. Ana Cláudia Alves Mendes Araújo, REQGAME - Requirements Elicitation with Gamification - An Experiment in Software Projects in a Federal Public Agency . Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process.

João Vitor Lopes de Farias, Journey - the use of RPG in a learning process , 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Active Learning . Abstract In the last decade gamification has gained greater prominence due to its ability to generate motivation and engagement by applying game elements in non-gaming contexts. The accession of gamification in the teaching process is a way to encourage the participation and constancy of students during learning. The RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a genre of game characterized mainly by four elements - the story narrative, the characters, the progress system and the challenges. These RPG elements are key to generating interest in players. When applied in the teaching environment, the RPG can promote greater interaction and immersion of students. Taking this into consideration, this work presents a learning process that applies gamification concepts together with RPG elements, called Jornada, whose proposal is to increase student engagement and motivation. From the application of this process in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class at the University of Brasilia (UnB), it was possible to collect information used to evaluate the feasibility of using the process in the classroom.

Abstract The application of gamified processes in the field of education has become increasingly common over the last few decades. Each project has unique characteristics, utilizing different techniques and being applied across various modalities and levels of education. However, creating a gamification is not just about inserting game elements into a given activity. There are tools designed to assist in this creation process, providing a step-by-step guide that contains methods and mechanics to be followed by those wishing to develop a gamified project. This work presents a systematic review of the literature, aiming to find these tools, referred to as gamification frameworks or models, and to combine the data found with other extracted criteria such as the countries and the educational levels where these frameworks are used. This review was divided into three stages - planning, execution, and summarization. In the planning stage, the research question, search string, acceptance criteria, and information to be extracted were defined. In the execution, the review is carried out, with the selection of primary studies and data extraction. In the summarization, the results are generated through graphs. At the end, an evaluation was conducted, considering the results obtained on the use of gamification frameworks in conjunction with other extraction criteria used in the review.

Paulo Markes Rodrigues de Oliveira Calado, Strategy to identify improvement opportunities in gamified applications . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2018 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract Currently, individuals are spending an increasing amount of time using devices connected to the internet, making it a challenge to capture and maintain the attention of a specific audience. Distraction occurs in an instant; a moment of inattention is all it takes for everyone to start checking notifications on their phones. The speed at which new technologies and software are adopted is only matched by the speed at which they are abandoned. Against this backdrop, an emerging strategy in various fields is the incorporation of playful elements as a means of fostering engagement, a concept known as gamification. While gamification proves to be a promising approach, it is essential that it continuously evolves to remain appealing and aligned with the expectations and development of its audience. A thorough analysis of a gamified initiative, aimed at identifying areas for improvement, is crucial for determining directions for evolution. Therefore, this study aims to define a strategy that enables the identification of potential improvements in gamified applications. Such improvements are highlighted by the evaluation of project indicators that measure usability and by direct feedback from users after testing the application. Direct interaction with users allows adjustments to be informed by the perspectives of those the project is intended for. The convergence of users\u0026#39; views in favor of the suggested improvements validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Leandro Alves Ferreira Santos, Gamified Software to Support Teaching and Learning Mathematics for Children . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2017 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Education, Active Learning . Abstract The usage of software has grown as computers become popular. There have emerged, both in academia and in the market, technological solutions for several areas, among them education. On the other hand, classroom teaching and learning continues to suffer from classical educational problems such as lack of student and teacher motivation and lack of clear educational goals. And although software supports learning across a range of disciplines and ages, childrens audiences, especially in mathematics, have been little contemplated with the benefits that technological solutions can bring. Therefore, the use of pedagogical approaches, such as Blooms Taxonomy and Formative Assessments, together with gamification techniques, such as Octalysis, can be used to develop a technological solution that contemplates this public. The present work aims to design and develop software to assist the teaching and learning of mathematics for children in the classroom. Among the results obtained are the design of gamification in Octalysis, the types of questions and pedagogical approach to be used, besides the software itself in operation. Tiago Ribeiro de Assunção, Application of Gamification in the About Social Network . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2017 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Soft Skills . Abstract In recent years, social media platforms have gained significant visibility in the technological landscape, becoming a predominant channel for communication and information dissemination among digital users. The Social Network About (RSA), a platform developed by a student from the University of Brasília, exemplifies this phenomenon by attracting users for initial use. However, it faces challenges in retaining these users over the long term. Gamification emerges as a promising methodology in this context, employing techniques designed to motivate and engage users in performing specific activities, maintaining their interest through different stages of software interaction. This study proposes the integration of a gamification framework into the Social Network About (RSA), positioning itself as a technological development project. The aim is to overcome the user retention challenges identified in RSA by applying gamification principles that encourage continuous and engaged user participation. Through this approach, the goal is not only to increase the platform\u0026#39;s usage time but also to enrich the user experience, promoting a deeper and more meaningful engagement with the social network. Therefore, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field of social software development, by exploring the application of gamification strategies as a means to improve the user-platform interaction dynamics in social networks.

Tags: Soft Skills, Teamwork . Abstract Employees are the main assets of software organizations and the software industry is characterized by frequent technological changes, which entail a continuous flow of new knowledge. Due to the volume of knowledge, software organizations have problems in identifying the content, location and use of knowledge, that is, difficulty in managing this knowledge. The Experiment Factory can be considered to represent the knowledge management initiative. A basic step inside the Experiment Factory is the experience base. The purpose of this work is the abstraction of the process of building a experience base for R \u0026amp; D laboratories, inserted in the context of Software Engineering teaching of a Brazilian public university, and that do not have a defined knowledge management process. To do this, was executed a case study in two R \u0026amp; D laboratories - ITRAC (Information Technology and Research Center) and LFS (Software Factory Laboratory), idealized from the need to create an environment that proposes to students, Experiences related to the development of software, processes and methodologies in this area. The implementation of the experience bases for R \u0026amp; D laboratories could be realized based on a process of structuring the base of experiments, within an Experiment Factory model that has been adapted to the context of R \u0026amp; D laboratories. The process adopted fulfills the objective of the work, since through it, was possible to build a base of experiences to maintain the knowledge generated by the objects of study. With this, the OwnCloud tool has become the experience base of the ITRAC and LFS R \u0026amp; D laboratories. Cristóvão de Lima Frinhani, Application of Natural Language Processing - A Support Tool for Correcting Essay Questions . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Nat Lang Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning . Abstract In the context of distance education (DE), which has been experiencing global expansion, one of the most significant challenges is the scalability of evaluating essay questions. This challenge impacts the efficiency of tutors and the quality of feedback provided to students, as grading such questions requires considerable time. To address this issue, a support system for pre-evaluation was developed, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automate the assignment of preliminary grades to student responses. The proposed system is divided into two main parts - the first applies semantic similarity algorithms to compare student responses with provided answer keys; the second part is a web interface that facilitates the registration of questions and answer keys, submission of responses by students, and allows the tutor to evaluate the responses. The accuracy of the system is continuously improved through tutor feedback, enabling ML to adjust the evaluation criteria as needed. The system was tested in the course on the fundamentals of computer architecture, where it demonstrated the ability to assign meaningful grades to student responses and revealed an improvement in the accuracy of evaluations based on tutor feedback. It is concluded that the pre-evaluation support system offers a promising solution to the challenges faced in evaluating essay questions in DE environments, enhancing the scalability of the grading process and the quality of feedback provided, with potential for application across various fields of knowledge.

Leandro Veloso Rodrigues, A study on the contribution of the Science Without Borders Program to the development of behavioral competencies in software engineering . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas, Fabiana Mendes . Tags: Soft Skills . Abstract Behavioral competencies relate to knowledge, attitudes and non-technical skills associated to the social, personal and cognitive areas. Behavioral competencies are as important as technical skills regarding the success of any software project. Many times, these skills are strongly linked to the achievement of tasks performed by software engineers. Some ways of developing these skills are related to personal exposure to new challenges and situations. The Science Without Borders (CSF) is a program which aims, among other objectives, to encourage, practice and develop non-technical skills in the Brazilians science students. The graduation in Software Engineering is one of the Brazilian courses that can make use of this program. However, what are the real benefits related to behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students who participate in CSF academic exchange project? The present document aims to answer this question by mapping the essential behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students and verifying how the CsF affects them. The verification of how former FGAs Software Engineering students observe the development of these type of competencies was obtained by a survey. According to the results of this project, the students believe that not only do they communicate better in portuguese, but also in different languages, theyve acquired a better critical thinking ability, also theyre more responsible and sensible to different cultures. Summarizing it, in their perspectives the CSF experience gave the support to the development oF some important behavioral competencies expected for a software engineer. Ludimila da Bela Cruz, Support Tool for the Construction of Gamification Projects . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, . Abstract Motivation is the driving force that leads people to achieve goals, objectives, or solve problems. This project proposes the creation of a tool that, through the use of gamification elements, allows the user to shape that motivation. The idea of using gamification to make people feel as motivated in real life as they do while playing has been explored by various authors in recent years. Integrating technology with gamification aims to extend the reach of gamification to the public. Gamification not only uses game elements to motivate but also generates engagement, making people committed to their personal goals, corporate objectives, or any other cause where gamification is applied. The development of the tool began with a literature review, from which a specific gamification model was selected to form the core of the tool. The initial proposal was crafted with the intention of providing users with a support tool for the construction of gamification projects. The developed tool aligns with this philosophy.

The main services are available - Express which is a system that is primarily maintained by SERPRO, and owncloud, software that implements the sharing of any files in the cloud. These services increase the productivity of the factory members and increase their collaboration in projects developed internally.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2014 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Digital Transformation . Abstract This work aims to evaluate the deployment of a Service Desk tool for IT service management in a public organization, aligning with its strategic objectives, daily operations, organizational needs, and the ITIL v3 infrastructure library. IT services are crucial for organizational activities, with management applications being integral for client access to these services. In the public sector, the increasing demand for quality service delivery emphasizes the importance of effective IT management applications to adapt to constant IT changes. The study identifies the lack of proper IT service management or flawed management as a source of service availability issues, resource overallocation, and negative impacts on IT\u0026#39;s reputation. It focuses on the Ministry \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; scenario, highlighting the necessity for an effective IT Service Management tool, OTRS, based on Incident Management processes to improve the IT Governance Index (iGovTI). This End Graduation Work seeks to assess the implementation process of OTRS and its potential to enhance IT Service Management governance. Greg Ouyama Martins, Evaluation of algorithms for sorting digital documents retrieved in search . Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2013 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: , Nat Lang Processing . Abstract The quest for information originated from libraries, where it was possible to retrieve necessary data through consultations using catalog cards, organizing books by title, author, year, or publisher. With technological advancements, this process was automated, allowing these tasks to be performed on computers. However, due to the vast volume of available information, efficiently finding specific information can be challenging, making the search process exhaustive and complex. To address this issue, there are studies and implementations concerning the sorting of retrieved information. It is also relevant to apply techniques for customized queries based on criteria defined by users. This work aims to analyze the effectiveness of dynamic and static algorithms in sorting retrieved information, exploring the customization of queries in open-source search engines. We will evaluate which algorithm offers greater accuracy, using precision x recall metrics, which allow for a degree of customization in queries, including user profiles from the four engineering courses at the University of Brasília  Faculdade do Gama, and how software engineering can enhance the sorting and retrieval of information.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2016 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas, Fabiana Mendes . Tags: Soft Skills . Abstract Behavioral competencies relate to knowledge, attitudes and non-technical skills associated to the social, personal and cognitive areas. Behavioral competencies are as important as technical skills regarding the success of any software project. Many times, these skills are strongly linked to the achievement of tasks performed by software engineers. Some ways of developing these skills are related to personal exposure to new challenges and situations. The Science Without Borders (CSF) is a program which aims, among other objectives, to encourage, practice and develop non-technical skills in the Brazilians science students. The graduation in Software Engineering is one of the Brazilian courses that can make use of this program. However, what are the real benefits related to behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students who participate in CSF academic exchange project? The present document aims to answer this question by mapping the essential behavioral competencies for Software Engineering students and verifying how the CsF affects them. The verification of how former FGAs Software Engineering students observe the development of these type of competencies was obtained by a survey. According to the results of this project, the students believe that not only do they communicate better in portuguese, but also in different languages, theyve acquired a better critical thinking ability, also theyre more responsible and sensible to different cultures. Summarizing it, in their perspectives the CSF experience gave the support to the development oF some important behavioral competencies expected for a software engineer.

Senior Project (Bachelor of Software Engineering) - University of Brasília (Brazil), 2022 Advisor(s): Cristiane Ramos, Sergio Freitas . Tags: Education, Learning Analytics . Abstract Identifying factors that influence academic dropout is crucial for coordinators to take preventive actions against student desertion. This thesis aims to explore the current state of research in the field, seeking to understand the main factors associated with academic dropout and how they can be applied in predictive models of dropout. A quantitative, exploratory, and explanatory applied research was conducted, using case study techniques and bibliographic research. The systematic literature review indicated that dropout could be predicted by academic, demographic, and learning factors. Using these factors, predictive models were developed with the help of machine learning algorithms, whose predictions proved sensitive to changes in course flows. It concludes that academic, demographic, and learning factors are effective in predicting dropout, with the selection and application method of these factors being crucial for achieving accurate predictive results. Moreover, the application of academic factors in predictive models requires consideration of the specific context of the analyzed data.

Five different typography sizes are included out of the box: Class\tBody font size\nprose-sm Gray scale prose-gray (default) 0.875rem (14px) prose-base (default) 1rem (16px) prose-lg 1.125rem (18px) prose-xl 1.25rem (20px) prose-2xl 1.5rem (24px) These can be used in combination with Tailwind’s breakpoint modifiers to change the overall font size of a piece of content at different viewport sizes:\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose md:prose-lg lg:prose-xl\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; Everything about the provided size modifiers has been hand-tuned by professional designers to look as beautiful as possible, including the relationships between font sizes, heading spacing, code block padding, and more.\nSize modifiers are designed to be used with the multi-class modifier pattern and must be used in conjunction with the base prose class.\nAlways include the prose class when adding a size modifier\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose prose-lg\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; To learn about customizing the included type scales, read the documentation on customizing the CSS.\nAdapting to dark mode Each default color theme includes a hand-designed dark mode version that you can trigger by adding the prose-invert class:\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose dark:prose-invert\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; To learn about creating your own color themes, read the adding custom color themes documentation.\n​ Element modifiers Use element modifiers to customize the style of individual elements in your content directly in your HTML:\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose prose-img:rounded-xl prose-headings:underline prose-a:text-blue-600\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; This makes it easy to do things like style links to match your brand, add a border radius to images, and tons more.\nHere’s a complete list of available element modifiers: Modifier Target prose-headings:{utility} h1, h2, h3, h4, th prose-lead:{utility} [class~=\u0026ldquo;lead\u0026rdquo;] prose-h1:{utility} h1 prose-h2:{utility} h2 prose-h3:{utility} h3 prose-h4:{utility} h4 prose-p:{utility} p prose-a:{utility} a prose-blockquote:{utility} blockquote prose-figure:{utility} figure prose-figcaption:{utility} figcaption prose-strong:{utility} strong prose-em:{utility} em prose-code:{utility} code prose-pre:{utility} pre prose-ol:{utility} ol prose-ul:{utility} ul prose-li:{utility} li prose-table:{utility} table prose-thead:{utility} thead prose-tr:{utility} tr prose-th:{utility} th prose-td:{utility} td prose-img:{utility} img prose-video:{utility} video prose-hr:{utility} hr When stacking these modifiers with other modifiers like hover, you most likely want the other modifier to come first:\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose prose-a:text-blue-600 hover:prose-a:text-blue-500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; Read the Tailwind CSS documentation on ordering stacked modifiers to learn more. ​ Overriding max-width Each size modifier comes with a baked in max-width designed to keep the content as readable as possible. This isn’t always what you want though, and sometimes you’ll want the content to just fill the width of its container.\nIn those cases, all you need to do is add max-w-none to your content to override the embedded max-width:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;grid grid-cols-4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-span-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!-- ... --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-span-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose max-w-none\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r{{ markdown }}\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Advanced topics ​ Undoing typography styles If you have a block of markup embedded in some content that shouldn’t inherit the prose styles, use the not-prose class to sandbox it:\n\u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;prose\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;My Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;not-prose\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!-- Some example or demo that needs to be prose-free --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!-- ... --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; Note that you can’t nest new prose instances within a not-prose block at this time. ​\nAdding custom color themes You can create your own color theme by adding a new key in the typography section of your tailwind.config.js file and providing your colors under the css key:\ntailwind.config.js\rmodule.exports = {\rtheme: {\rextend: {\rtypography: ({ theme }) =\u0026gt;

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Learning Analytics, Machine Learning . Abstract Researchers have been investigating attrition in higher education, identifying two categories - students who leave the university and those who abandon higher education altogether, negatively affecting institutions, students, and society. Since 1995, in Brazil, the creation of ANDIFES has led to more frequent studies on graduation, retention, and attrition in Brazilian universities, focusing on institutional attrition, characterized by a student\u0026#39;s departure from their original course. The University of Brasília (UnB) has implemented strategies to increase student retention in undergraduate courses. This work aimed to develop and test an analysis model to predict attrition in face-to-face courses, through a Systematic Literature Review to identify impact factors and define indicators extracted from UnB\u0026#39;s academic systems. The model, named MAGRA, combines indicators with machine learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out. Tests conducted at the Faculdade do Gama (FGA) and UnB indicated that enrollment frequency in subjects could predict completion difficulties. The research suggests that to improve the early identification of at-risk students, adjustments in feedback mechanisms, the inclusion of new systems, improvement in data quality, and adjustments in algorithm parameters are necessary.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2023 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Soft Skills . Abstract The gamification of non-playful activities has gained traction in the industrial, service, and educational sectors, demonstrating that introducing game elements into an environment can make activities more engaging, fun, and enjoyable. This approach has proven to be an effective strategy for motivating and involving individuals, recognized as a valuable tool for managers. In the context of the Military Police of the Federal District, which is responsible for overt policing and maintaining public order in the nation\u0026#39;s capital, Intelligence Activity plays a crucial role in supporting strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This study introduces the Gamified Intelligence Reporting Process (GIRP), developed for the Military Police Intelligence System. The gamification model was based on the Octalysis framework, supplemented by statistical techniques derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and document analyses. The aim of the GIRP is to improve the quality of intelligence reports through gamification, benefiting from an iterative evaluation and planning process. Additionally, the work provides a theoretical foundation on gamification, Intelligence Activity, Public Security, and an overview of the Military Police of the Federal District. RAMOS, C.

Abstract Gamification is a way to use game elements and apply them in real-world contexts to motivate people and create a more productive environment. Considered a tool aimed at increasing engagement, gamification can be applied across various areas, including organizational activities. This work proposes a Case Study at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), analyzing the effects of a gamification solution applied to the Innovation Macroprocess (MPI), which is responsible for managing research, development, and innovation solutions for the sustainability of the Brazilian agribusiness. The main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing engagement, collaboration, and motivation of employees regarding the use of the Asset Management System (Gestec), a computational tool that implements part of the MPI. Initially, a study of the theoretical foundations of gamification was conducted, followed by a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the main frameworks, techniques, and effects of gamification solutions in organizational environments. Subsequently, a Case Study was initiated with the identification of the motivational profile of the target audience and the development of a project that includes the application of sixteen gamification requirements. Of these, ten requirements were prioritized and implemented for the experimentation phase, which was made available to a group of twenty-seven participants to evaluate the effects of the proposed solution. Overall, the results indicated an improvement in the motivational perception regarding the use of the system. Back to Top 2022 CABELLO, A. F.,ARRUDA, J. A.,IMBROISI, D.,FERREIRA, G.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2021 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Gamification, Requirements Engineering . Abstract The success of a software project is closely linked to the clarity and accuracy of its requirements. These requirements outline the project scope and establish the expected operation of the software. Thus, the requirement elicitation phase is a critical milestone in the software development lifecycle, demanding excellent communication, cooperation, and motivation skills among all stakeholders. However, challenges such as effective collaboration and scheduling coordination can compromise engagement and active participation in this process. To overcome these obstacles and stimulate participation, gamification has proven to be an effective strategy by applying game mechanics in non-game contexts. Within this framework, Octalysis, a gamification framework developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a methodology to tailor and customize gamification according to the user profiles involved. This study introduces REQGame, an innovative method that integrates gamification into the requirement elicitation process, based on the Octalysis framework. The aim is to enhance the involvement and engagement of participants, also evaluating the positive effects that the implementation of gamification techniques can bring to the process. MARIANI, C.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2020 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Software Architecture . Abstract The adoption of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in the implementation of services and microservices in distributed system applications facilitates the use of development standards, maintenance, flexibility in service development, and interoperability between services and systems. The Computing Center (CPD) of the University of Brasília (UnB) engages in various software automation processes, ranging from the maintenance of existing systems to the development and deployment of new technological solutions. Continuous monitoring of the performance of services, microservices, and systems becomes crucial. This study, of an exploratory nature, aims to investigate solutions and tools for implementing and managing the monitoring of distributed services and systems at UnB, through systematic mapping. The research was theoretically grounded to develop a model that was applied to the monitoring module of the UnB service bus. Simulations were conducted with the developed solution, allowing the analysis of the integration between the service bus and the proposed monitoring tool. BATISTA, A. C. D.,SOUZA, R. M.,SILVA, F. Q.

Master\u0026#39;s Thesis in Applied Computing, University of Brasília (Brazil), 2019 Advisor(s): Sergio Freitas . Tags: Software Architecture . Abstract This work introduces the NatVI framework, focusing on the integration between Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Agile Development, and Quality Assurance (QA). Developed from a literature review that identified and evaluated the trade-offs between SOA and agile methods, NatVI aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the software development cycle, especially for service-based applications. It includes best practices from SOA and agile principles, emphasizing the importance of QA, essential for software projects in dynamic business environments. A case study in a unit of the Brazilian federal government assessed the application of NatVI, observing improvements in software quality, understanding of agile methods, and client satisfaction with the development process. The study also highlighted limitations, such as the size of the IT team and the number of clients involved, leading to a subjective evaluation through semi-structured interviews. The preliminary results suggest that NatVI has potential, but also highlight the need for further research, paving the way for future studies on emerging technologies, such as containers and DevOps.
